Question:3. The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. 
Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. 
To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. 
This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named datacenter-vnet in the East US region with any IPv4 CIDR block.

Use below given Azure Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on the azure-client host to retrieve these credentials)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 5: Fill Out the Instance Details
In the Create Virtual Network wizard, fill in the necessary details:

Subscription: Choose the appropriate subscription from the dropdown.
Resource Group: You can either select an existing resource group or create a new one.
Region: Set the region to East US to meet the requirement.
Name: Set the VNet name to datacenter-vnet.
Once all the details are entered, click on the Next: IP Addresses button to move to the next configuration step.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 6: Configure IP Addressing
In the IP Addresses tab, you can either:
Keep the default IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) or
Modify the CIDR block to meet your specific needs (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16).
Review the settings and click on the Next: Review + Create button to proceed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 7: Review the Configuration
The Review + Create tab will display all the configuration settings for your VNet.
Ensure that all the details (such as name, region, IP addresses, etc.) are correct.
Once reviewed, click on the Create button to start the deployment of the VNet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Validation and Verification
Once the VNet is successfully created, you can verify its creation and properties by navigating to the Virtual Networks page in the Azure Portal.

In the Azure portal, go to Virtual Networks and search for datacenter-vnet.
Click on the newly created VNet to see its details, including the IP address range, subnet configuration, and more.
