Question:3. The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. 
Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. 
To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. 
This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named datacenter-vnet in the East US region with any IPv4 CIDR block.

Use below given Azure Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on the azure-client host to retrieve these credentials)

# Validation and Verification

● Once the VNet is successfully created, you can verify its creation and properties by navigating to the Virtual Networks page in the Azure Portal.

1. In the Azure portal, go to Virtual Networks and search for datacenter-vnet.

2. Click on the newly created VNet to see its details, including the IP address range, subnet configuration, and more.






Optional (CMD Commands)

Prerequisites
Azure Subscription and credentials:

Portal URL: Azure Portal
Username: kk_lab_user_main-1aa509dbd09f4287@azurekmlprodkodekloud.onmicrosoft.com
Password: b%XpR4P^3Ad!%y!F
Ensure that the necessary permissions are in place for the account to create resources in the Azure Subscription.

Azure CLI or PowerShell installed and configured on your system (or alternatively, you can work directly in the Azure Portal).

Access to the Azure Cloud Shell, which provides a browser-based terminal to execute Azure CLI commands directly.

Step-by-Step Procedure
Step 1: Login to Azure
We will use Azure CLI for creating the resources. If using the Azure portal, this step is skipped.

Login using Azure CLI:
Open your terminal or Cloud Shell.
Use the following command to log in with the provided credentials:

az login -u kk_lab_user_main-1aa509dbd09f4287@azurekmlprodkodekloud.onmicrosoft.com -p b%XpR4P^3Ad!%y!F
This command authenticates the user with Azure using the provided credentials (username and password).
Verify login:

After successful login, check the status by running:


az account show
This will display details of the active subscription.
Step 2: Create a Virtual Network (VNet)
Choose a Region and CIDR Block:

We will create the VNet in the East US region.
A commonly used private CIDR block for VNets is 10.0.0.0/16.
Run the Azure CLI Command to Create the VNet:

Use the following command to create the VNet:


az network vnet create \
  --name datacenter-vnet \
  --resource-group <your_resource_group_name> \
  --location eastus \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16
Explanation:

az network vnet create: Command to create a VNet.
--name datacenter-vnet: Specifies the name of the VNet as datacenter-vnet.
--resource-group <your_resource_group_name>: Replace <your_resource_group_name> with the name of the Azure resource group where the VNet will be created.
--location eastus: Specifies that the VNet will be created in the East US region.
--address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16: Specifies the CIDR block (subnet range) for the VNet.
Validate the VNet Creation:

After executing the above command, you should see an output with details of the VNet, confirming that it was created successfully. Example output:


{
  "newVNet": {
    "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/datacenter-vnet",
    "location": "eastus",
    "name": "datacenter-vnet",
    "properties": {
      "addressSpace": {
        "addressPrefixes": ["10.0.0.0/16"]
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
Step 3: Verify the VNet Creation in Azure Portal
Navigate to the Azure Portal.
In the search bar, type Virtual networks and select the option.
In the list of VNets, find the datacenter-vnet you just created in the East US region.
Click on the VNet to verify its properties, including the address space (10.0.0.0/16), subnets, and other configurations.
Conclusion and Validation
Step 4: Confirm the VNet Creation
You can run the following Azure CLI command to list all the virtual networks and confirm that datacenter-vnet exists:


az network vnet list --query "[].{Name:name, Location:location}" --output table
This command will display a list of all VNets, including datacenter-vnet, showing its name and location.

Step 5: Troubleshooting
Authentication Issues: If you encounter login issues, check your username and password for accuracy.
Permissions: Ensure that your Azure account has the necessary permissions to create a VNet.
Region Issues: If you’re unable to create the VNet in the East US region, ensure that the region is available in your subscription or choose another available region.
Additional Considerations
Resource Group: If the resource group you’re creating the VNet in does not already exist, you can create it first using the following command:

az group create --name <your_resource_group_name> --location eastus
Subnets: Once the VNet is created, you can create subnets within it. This can be done via Azure CLI, PowerShell, or directly in the Azure Portal.
Example: Creating a Subnet within the VNet

az network vnet subnet create \
  --name default \
  --vnet-name datacenter-vnet \
  --resource-group <your_resource_group_name> \
  --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
This command will create a subnet named default within the datacenter-vnet, with the address range 10.0.1.0/24.

Conclusion
The VNet creation process is simple and involves logging into Azure, creating the VNet with an appropriate CIDR block, and verifying its success through the Azure portal. Azure CLI commands are used here for automation and repeatability. By following the above steps, the datacenter-vnet should be successfully created in the East US region with the desired configuration.
