Question:3. The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. 
Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. 
To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. 
This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named datacenter-vnet in the East US region with any IPv4 CIDR block.

Optional (CMD Commands)

###`Prerequisites:`

● Azure Subscription & Credentials:

		● Azure Portal URL: Azure Portal
		● Username: kk_lab_user_main-1aa509dbd09f4287@azurekmlprodkodekloud.onmicrosoft.com
		● Password: b%XpR4P^3Ad!%y!F
		● Permissions: Ensure the account has the required permissions to create resources in the Azure Subscription.

● Tools Required:

		● Azure CLI or PowerShell installed and configured on your system. Alternatively, you can use the Azure Portal.
		● Azure Cloud Shell: A browser-based terminal to execute Azure CLI commands directly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Step-by-Step Procedure:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###`Step 1: Login to Azure`

1. Login via Azure CLI:

● Open your terminal or Cloud Shell.

● Use the following command to log in with the provided credentials:

		az login -u kk_lab_user_main-1aa509dbd09f4287@azurekmlprodkodekloud.onmicrosoft.com -p b%XpR4P^3Ad!%y!F

● This will authenticate the user with Azure using the provided credentials.

2.Verify the login:

● After successful login, confirm the active subscription by running:

		az account show

● This will display the details of the active subscription.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###`Step 2: Create a Virtual Network (VNet)`

1. Choose a Region and CIDR Block:

	● Region: East US

	● CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16 (This will define the address space for the VNet)

2. Create the VNet: Use the following Azure CLI command to create the VNet:


		az network vnet create \
		  --name datacenter-vnet \
		  --resource-group <your_resource_group_name> \
		  --location eastus \
		  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16
		  
Explanation:

		● az network vnet create: Command to create a new Virtual Network.

		● --name datacenter-vnet: Specifies the name of the VNet.

		● --resource-group <your_resource_group_name>: Replace <your_resource_group_name> with the desired resource group name.

		● --location eastus: Specifies that the VNet will be created in the East US region.

		● --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16: CIDR block to define the address space for the VNet.

3. Validate VNet Creation:

● Once the command executes successfully, it will provide a JSON output confirming the creation of the VNet. Example output:

			{
			  "newVNet": {
				"id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/datacenter-vnet",
				"location": "eastus",
				"name": "datacenter-vnet",
				"properties": {
				  "addressSpace": {
					"addressPrefixes": ["10.0.0.0/16"]
				  }
				}
			  }
			}
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
###`Step 3: Verify VNet Creation in Azure Portal`

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal:

	● Go to the Azure Portal.

2. Search for Virtual Networks:

	● In the search bar, type Virtual Networks and select the option.

3. Find Your VNet:

	● Locate datacenter-vnet in the list of VNets under the East US region.

	● Click on the VNet to view its properties, including address space, subnets, and other configurations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###`Step 4: Confirm VNet Creation via Azure CLI`

1. List All VNets: To confirm that the VNet datacenter-vnet has been created successfully, run the following command:


		az network vnet list --query "[].{Name:name, Location:location}" --output table

This will display a table with the name and location of all VNets in your subscription, confirming that datacenter-vnet exists in the East US region.

Step 5: Troubleshooting

● Authentication Issues:

  ● Ensure that the username and password are correct.

  ● Verify that your account has the necessary permissions to create resources.

● Permissions:
	
  ● If you encounter permission issues, check your role and access level in the Azure subscription.

● Region Issues:
	
  ● If the East US region is unavailable in your subscription, choose another available region and update the --location flag accordingly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###`Additional Considerations`

● Creating a Resource Group: If the resource group doesn’t exist, create it using the following command:


		az group create --name <your_resource_group_name> --location eastus

● Creating Subnets: Once the VNet is created, you may want to create subnets within it. You can do so via Azure CLI, PowerShell, or directly in the Azure Portal. To create a subnet, use the following CLI command:


		az network vnet subnet create \
		  --name default \
		  --vnet-name datacenter-vnet \
		  --resource-group <your_resource_group_name> \
		  --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
		  
● This creates a subnet named default within the datacenter-vnet with the address prefix 10.0.1.0/24.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###`Conclusion`
By following the above steps, you should be able to create a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure successfully. The process involves logging into Azure, using Azure CLI to create the VNet with an appropriate CIDR block, and verifying the creation in both CLI and the Azure portal. If needed, additional configurations such as subnets can be created as well.
