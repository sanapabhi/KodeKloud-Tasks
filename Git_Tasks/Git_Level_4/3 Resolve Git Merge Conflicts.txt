ANSWER:
	1. SSH into the Storage Server
	
    1. Open your terminal.
    2. SSH into the storage server:
             
       #ssh max@<storage-server-ip>
	   
       Replace <storage-server-ip> with the actual IP address of the storage server.
	   
    3. Enter the password when prompted:       
       Max_pass123
	   
	   
2. Navigate to the Repository
    1. Change directory to the repository location:
             
       #cd /home/max/story-blog
	   
	   #git status
			Output:
				On branch master
				Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
				  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
				nothing to commit, working directory clean
	   
3. Check Repository Status and Fix Issues
    1. Check the status of the repository:
              
		#git status
       This will show you if there are any uncommitted changes or other issues.
	   
    2. If there are changes to be committed:
         
       #git add .
	   
       #git commit -m "Fix typo in story-index.txt"
			Output:
				On branch master
				Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
				  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
				nothing to commit, working directory clean
	   
    3. To push the changes:       
       
       #git push origin Master --force 
			 Output:
				Username for 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': max
				Password for 'http://max@git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': 
				Counting objects: 18, done.
				Delta compression using up to 36 threads.
				Compressing objects: 100% (16/16), done.
				Writing objects: 100% (18/18), 2.86 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
				Total 18 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0)
				remote: . Processing 1 references
				remote: Processed 1 references in total
				To http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog.git
				 + ad70783...ab326ee master -> master (forced update)
	   
       Make sure you are on the correct branch (Master in this example). Adjust if your branch name is different.
	   
    4. If you face issues while pushing (e.g., authentication errors, merge conflicts):
        ◦ For authentication errors, ensure that SSH keys are correctly set up or use the correct credentials.
        ◦ For merge conflicts, pull the latest changes first, resolve conflicts, commit, and then push:
          
          
          #git pull origin Master'
			Output:
				From http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog
				 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
				Already up-to-date.
				
        > Resolve conflicts in files
		
          #git add .
		  
          #git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
			 Output:
				On branch master
				Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
				nothing to commit, working directory clean
		  
          #git push origin Master --force
				 Output:
					Username for 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': max
					Password for 'http://max@git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': 
					Everything up-to-date

    2. Find and correct the typo:
