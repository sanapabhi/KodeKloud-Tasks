QUESTION:5.The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games present on Storage server in Stratos DC. 
One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. Find below more details to accomplish this task:



Look for the stashed changes under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games git repository, and restore the stash with stash@{1} identifier. Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.

ANSWER:
Understanding the Task
We need to restore a specific stashed change (stash@{1}) from a Git repository located on a storage server. After restoring, we need to commit and push the changes to the origin.

Prerequisites
    • Access to the storage server with SSH or similar.
    • Basic Git knowledge.

Steps
1. Connect to the Storage Server
    • Establish a secure connection to the storage server where the Git repository is located. Use SSH or any other appropriate method.
	 thor@jumphost ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01 
	 natasha@ststor01's password: 
	 [natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo su -
	 [sudo] password for natasha:
	 
2. Navigate to the Repository
    • Once connected, use the command line to navigate to the repository's directory:
      
      #cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games
      
3. List Stashed Changes
    • To see available stashes, run:
      
      #git stash list
	  OUTPUT:
	  stash@{0}: WIP on master: e474d24 initial commit
	  stash@{1}: WIP on master: e474d24 initial commit
      
      This will display a list of stashed changes with their respective identifiers.
	  
4. Restore the Desired Stash
    • Apply the stashed changes with identifier stash@{1}:
      
      #git stash apply stash@{1}
	  OUTPUT:
	  On branch master
	  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
	  Changes to be committed:
	  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
      new file:   welcome.txt
      
      This will reapply the changes from the specified stash to your working directory.
	  
5. Review Changes
    • Before committing, carefully review the applied changes using:
      
      #git status
	  OUTPUT:
	  On branch master
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
	Changes to be committed:
	(use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
     new file:   welcome.txt
      
      and 
      
      #git diff
      
6. Commit Changes
    • If the changes are as expected, commit them:
      
      #git commit -m "Restoring stashed changes from stash@{1}"
	 OUTPUT:
	 [master 97c56b0] Restoring stashed changes from stash@{1}
	 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
	 create mode 100644 welcome.txt
      
      Replace the message with a more descriptive one if needed.
	  
7. Push Changes to Origin
    • Push the committed changes to the remote repository:
      
      #git push origin <branch_name>
	  e.g., OUTPUT,
	  [root@ststor01 games]#  git push origin master
		Enumerating objects: 4, done.
		Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
		Delta compression using up to 36 threads
		Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
		Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 325 bytes | 325.00 KiB/s, done.
		Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
		To /opt/games.git
		   e474d24..97c56b0  master -> master
      
      Replace <branch_name> with the actual name of your branch.

Example
Assuming you're connected to the storage server and in the correct directory:

# List stashes
git stash list
# Output:
# stash@{0}: WIP on master: 315c32a Add new feature
# stash@{1}: WIP on master: 9d2f1b5 Fix bug

# Apply stash@{1}
git stash apply stash@{1}
# Review changes using git status and git diff

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Restored stashed changes from stash@{1}"

# Push to origin
git push origin master

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Additional Considerations
    • Conflict Resolution: If applying the stash causes conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually before committing.
    • Stash Management: Consider using descriptive names for stashes to make them easier to identify later.
    • Backup: It's recommended to keep backups of your repository, especially before making significant changes.
