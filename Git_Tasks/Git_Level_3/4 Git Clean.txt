QUESTION:4.The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news present on Storage server in Stratos DC. 
One of the developers mistakenly created a couple of files under this repository, but now they want to clean this repository without adding/pushing any new files. Find below more details:

Clean the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news git repository without adding/pushing any new files, make sure git status is clean.

ANSWER:

Understanding the Problem:
    • A git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news exists on a Storage server in Stratos DC.
    • It contains unwanted files that need to be removed.
    • The goal is to clean the repository without adding or pushing any new files.
	
Solution:

We'll use the git clean command to remove untracked files and directories from the working directory.
Steps:
    1. SSH into the Storage server:
       
       #ssh user@storage_server_ip
       
       Replace user with the appropriate username and storage_server_ip with the server's IP address.
    2. Navigate to the repository:
       
       #cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
       
    3. Check the status of the repository:
       
       #git status
       
       This command will show any untracked files or changes.
    4. Dry run to see what would be removed:
       
       #git clean -n
       
       This command simulates the git clean operation without actually deleting anything. It will list the files and directories that would be removed.
    5. Remove untracked files:
       
       #git clean -f
       
       This command forcefully removes all untracked files. Use with caution!
    6. Remove untracked directories:
       
       #git clean -fd
       
       This command forcefully removes all untracked files and directories.
    7. Verify the status:
       
       #git status
       
       This should show that the working directory is clean.
	   
Explanation of flags:
    • -n: Dry run, shows what would be removed without actually deleting.
    • -f: Forcefully removes untracked files.
    • -d: Forcefully removes untracked directories.
	
Important Considerations:
    • Caution: The git clean -f and -fd commands are destructive. Use them carefully, as they permanently delete files.
    • Backup: Consider backing up the repository before running git clean to avoid data loss.
    • Ignored files: Files listed in .gitignore will not be removed by git clean.
    • Untracked files: Only files that are not tracked by git will be removed. Files that have been added but not committed will not be affected.
	
By following these steps and understanding the implications of the commands, you can effectively clean the git repository without affecting the committed history.

Additional Notes:
    • If you only want to remove specific files or directories, you can use wildcards with the git clean command. For example, git clean -f "tmp/*" would remove all files in the tmp directory.
    • To remove untracked files recursively from all subdirectories, you can use the -r flag: git clean -rf.
    • For more advanced usage and options, refer to the git clean documentation.
By carefully using the git clean command and understanding its behavior, you
