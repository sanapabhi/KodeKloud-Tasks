QUESTION:
The Nautilus developers are engaged in active development on one of the project repositories located at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster. 
During testing, several test branches were created, and now they require cleanup. Here are the requirements provided to the DevOps team:

1.On the Storage server in Stratos DC, delete a branch named xfusioncorp_cluster from the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster Git repository.

ANSWER:
STEPS TO DELETE THE BRANCH

1.Access the Storage Server:
	First, you need to connect to the Storage server where the repository is located. This is typically done using SSH.

2.Navigate to the Repository Directory:
	Once connected, navigate to the directory where the Git repository is located.

3.Check the Current Branch:
	Ensure you are not on the branch you want to delete. If you are, switch to another branch.

4.Delete the Branch:
	Use the Git command to delete the branch.


DETAILED COMMANDS AND EXAMPLE

1. Access the Storage Server
Use SSH to connect to the Storage server. Replace username and storageserver with your actual username and server address.

#ssh username@storageserver

2. Navigate to the Repository Directory
Change to the directory where the Git repository is located.

#cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster

3. Check the Current Branch
Ensure you are not on the xfusioncorp_cluster branch. You can check your current branch with:

#git branch

	If you are on the xfusioncorp_cluster branch, switch to another branch, such as main or master:

#git checkout main

4. Delete the Branch
Now, delete the xfusioncorp_cluster branch locally:

#git branch -d xfusioncorp_cluster

	If the branch has not been merged and you want to force delete it, use:

#git branch -D xfusioncorp_cluster

Example
Here is a complete example of the commands:

	#ssh username@storageserver
	#cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster
	#git branch
	#git checkout main
	#git branch -d xfusioncorp_cluster

> Or, if you need to force delete:

	#git branch -D xfusioncorp_cluster

VERIFICATION	
After deleting the branch, you can verify it by listing all branches:

#git branch

This should no longer show the xfusioncorp_cluster branch.
