QUESTION:
The DevOps team established a new Git repository last week, which remains unused at present. 
However, the Nautilus application development team now requires a copy of this repository on the Storage Server in the Stratos DC. Follow the provided details to clone the repository:

1.The repository to be cloned is located at /opt/ecommerce.git

2.Clone this Git repository to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Ensure no modifications are made to the repository during the cloning process.

ANSWER:

> Connect to the Storage Server: First, you need to connect to the Storage Server. This can be done using SSH. Replace username and storage_server_ip with the appropriate values

    #ssh username@storage_server_ip

> Open a Terminal: Start by opening your terminal or command prompt.

> Navigate to the Target Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. In this case, it’s /usr/src/kodekloudrepos.

    #cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

> Clone the Repository: Use the git clone command to clone the repository. The syntax for cloning a repository into a specific directory is git clone <repository_path> <target_directory>. 
Since you want to clone the repository directly into /usr/src/kodekloudrepos, you can use the following command:

    #git clone /opt/ecommerce.git .

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Here, the . at the end of the command specifies that the repository should be cloned into the current directory.

Example
Let’s go through an example step-by-step:

> Open Terminal: Open your terminal.

> Navigate to the Target Directory:

    #cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

> Clone the Repository:

    git clone /opt/ecommerce.git .

After running these commands, the repository located at /opt/ecommerce.git will be cloned into the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory without any modifications.
