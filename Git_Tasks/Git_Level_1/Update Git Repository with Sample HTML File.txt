QUESTION:
The Nautilus development team has initiated a new project development, establishing various Git repositories to manage each project's source code. 
Recently, a repository named /opt/cluster.git was created. The team has provided a sample index.html file located on the jump host under the /tmp directory. 
This repository has been cloned to /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on the storage server in the Stratos DC.

1.Copy the sample index.html file from the jump host to the storage server placing it within the cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster.
2.Add and commit the file to the repository.
3.Push the changes to the master branch.

ANSWER:

Step 1: Copy the index.html file from the jump host to the storage server

	Log in to the jump host and use the scp command to copy the file to the storage server:

#scp /tmp/index.html <username>@<storage_server>:/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
<username>@<storage_server> password:

Output	 
index.html                                             100%   27    38.9KB/s   00:00 

Replace <username> with your actual username and <storage_server> with the hostname or IP address of the storage server.

Step 2: Add and commit the file to the repository

	Log in to the storage server and navigate to the cloned repository:

#ssh <username>@<storage_server>

#cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster

	Add the index.html file to the repository:
#git add index.html

	Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
#git commit -m "Add index.html file"

Output	
[master a524e55]  Added index.html file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html
 
	check the status og git
#git status

Output	
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   info.txt
        modified:   welcome.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Step 3: Push the changes to the master branch

	Push the committed changes to the master branch:
#git push origin master

Output	
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 36 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 335 bytes | 335.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To /opt/ecommerce.git
   fe89910..a524e55  master -> master

This will copy the index.html file from the jump host to the storage server, add it to the Git repository, commit the changes, and push them to the master branch.

IMP NOTE: IF It looks like there might be a permission issue with the directory /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster. Letâ€™s resolve this step-by-step with below Commands:
Step: Copy the index.html file again
From the jump host, use the scp command to copy the file to the storage server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Step 1: Check and Modify Permissions

	Log in to the storage server:
#ssh <username>@<storage_server>

	Check the current permissions of the directory:
#ls -ld /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster

Output	
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Aug  9 18:45 /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce/

	Change the permissions to allow writing (if necessary):
#sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster

Output	After made changes and apply ls -ld <File Path> output below shown
drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 4096 Aug  9 18:45 /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce/

	Ensure your user has ownership of the directory:
#sudo chown -R <username>:<groupname> /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster

Replace <username> with your actual username and <groupname> with your group name.
