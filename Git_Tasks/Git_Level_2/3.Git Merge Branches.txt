QUESTION:3.The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

Create a new branch devops in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. 
Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.
 
ANSWER:
 Here are the detailed steps and commands to achieve the requirements:

> Navigate to the repository directory:
	 #cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta

> Create a new branch devops from master:
	 #git checkout -b devops

> Copy the /tmp/index.html file into the repository:
	 #cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta/

> Add the copied file to the staging area:
	 #git add index.html

> Commit the changes in the devops branch:
	 #git commit -m "Add index.html to devops branch"

> Switch back to the master branch:
	 #git checkout master

> Merge the devops branch into master:
	 #git merge devops

> Push the changes to the origin for both branches:
	 #git push origin master
	 #git push origin devops

Example Walkthrough

Let’s go through an example step-by-step:

Navigate to the repository directory:
#cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta

Create a new branch devops from master:
#git checkout -b devops
Output:
Switched to a new branch 'devops'

Copy the /tmp/index.html file into the repository:
#cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta/

Verify the file is copied:
#ls /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta/
Output:
index.html

Add the copied file to the staging area:
#git add index.html

Commit the changes in the devops branch:
#git commit -m "Add index.html to devops branch"

Output:
[devops 1a2b3c4] Add index.html to devops branch
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
create mode 100644 index.html

Switch back to the master branch:
#git checkout master
Output:
Switched to branch 'master'

Merge the devops branch into master:
#git merge devops
Output:
Updating 1a2b3c4..5d6e7f8
Fast-forward

Push the changes to the origin for both branches:
#git push origin master
#git push origin devops
Output:
