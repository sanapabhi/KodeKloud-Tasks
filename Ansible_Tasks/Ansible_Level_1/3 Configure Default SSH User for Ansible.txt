QUESTION:3.The Nautilus DevOps team aims to manage all servers within the stack using Ansible, utilizing a common sudo user across all servers. They plan to use this user for various tasks on each server. 
While this isn't finalized, they're starting with testing. Ansible is already installed on the jump host via yum. Here's the requirement:

On the jump host, modify the default configuration of Ansible to enable the use of anita as the default SSH user for all hosts. Ensure to make changes within Ansible's default configuration without creating a new one.

ANSWERL:

To meet the requirement of setting up anita as the default SSH user for all hosts in Ansible, you need to modify Ansible's default configuration file, ansible.cfg. This file is typically located in /etc/ansible/ on the jump host.

Steps to Modify Ansible Configuration:

    1. Locate the Ansible Configuration File: The default configuration file is usually found at /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg. We'll edit this file to set anita as the default user.
	
    2. Edit the Configuration File: You can use a text editor like vi, vim, or nano to edit the configuration file.
             
		 #sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
		 
    3. Modify the Remote User Setting: Find the section in the file that sets the remote user for SSH connections. This section is typically under [defaults].
	
        ◦ Locate the line that starts with #remote_user =.
        ◦ Uncomment the line by removing the # at the beginning.
        ◦ Set it to anita.
       Here's how the relevant section will look:
`````````````````````````````````````````````````       
	   ini
       
       [defaults]
       # some other settings might be here
       
       remote_user = anita
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
	   
    4. Save and Exit:
        ◦ After making the changes, save the file and exit the editor.
        ◦ In vi or vim, you can do this by pressing Esc, then typing :wq, and hitting Enter.
		
Verifying the Configuration:

To ensure that Ansible is using anita as the default SSH user, you can test it by running an Ansible command or a playbook.

    1. Create a Simple Test Inventory File: If you don't have an inventory file already, create a basic one to test. Save it as test_inventory in your home directory or any preferred location.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
	   ini
       
       [all]
       localhost ansible_connection=local
`````````````````````````````````````````````````	
   
    2. Run a Test Ansible Command: Use the following command to check whether anita is being used as the default SSH user.
       
       
       ansible all -i ~/test_inventory -m ping
       If everything is set up correctly, Ansible will use anita as the user when attempting to connect to the host(s) listed in the inventory file.
	   
Explanation of the Output:
    • If Ansible successfully connects using anita, you will see a SUCCESS message indicating that the ping module ran correctly.
    • If there's an issue with the SSH connection (e.g., if anita doesn't have access to the host), you may see a failure message. Ensure that anita is set up correctly with the necessary SSH keys or password authentication on the target hosts.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Example Output:


localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
This output indicates that Ansible successfully connected to the localhost using anita and executed the ping module, which returned "pong".

Conclusion:
By modifying the ansible.cfg file to set anita as the remote_user, you ensure that all Ansible tasks will use this user by default unless overridden in a playbook or command. This centralizes user management, simplifying the process of running tasks across multiple servers.
