QUESTION:4.The Nautilus DevOps team needs to copy data from the jump host to all application servers in Stratos DC using Ansible. Execute the task with the following details:

a. Create an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory on jump_host and add all application servers as managed nodes.
b. Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml on the jump host to copy the /usr/src/finance/index.html file to all application servers, placing it at /opt/finance.

Note: Validation will run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Ensure the playbook functions properly without any extra arguments.

ANSWER:

Solution Overview

The task requires setting up an Ansible inventory file and a playbook to copy a file from the jump host to all application servers in Stratos DC. 
The inventory file will list all the application servers as managed nodes, and the playbook will automate the task of copying the specified file to these servers.

Step-by-Step Solution

Step 1: Create the Inventory File
    1. Path: /home/thor/ansible/inventory
	
		 #cd /home/thor/ansible/
		 
    2. Content: The inventory file should list all the application servers under a specific group (e.g., app_servers).
	
		 #vi inventory
		 
       Example inventory file:
       ini
       
       [app_servers]
       app01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
       app02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
       app03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com

`````````````````````````````````````````````````	   
e.g.,

stapp01 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n 
stapp02 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@
stapp03 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n

`````````````````````````````````````````````````
	   
       Explanation:
        ◦ [app_servers]: This defines a group of servers named app_servers.
        ◦ The lines following this group name list the FQDN or IP addresses of the servers that are part of this group.
		
		
Step 2: Create the Playbook
    1. Path: /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
	
    2. Content: The playbook will include tasks to copy the /usr/src/finance/index.html file from the jump host to the /opt/finance directory on each of the application servers.
       
		 #vi /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
		 
	   
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
Example playbook: 
  
       yaml
       
       ---
       - name: Copy index.html to application servers
         hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03 
         become: yes
       
         tasks:
           - name: Copy index.html to /opt/finance
             copy:
               src: /usr/src/finance/index.html
               dest: /opt/finance/index.html
               owner: root
               group: root
               mode: '0644' 
			   
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
			   
       Explanation:
        ◦ hosts: app_servers: This indicates that the tasks should run on all servers listed under the app_servers group in the inventory file.
        ◦ become: yes: This allows Ansible to execute the tasks with elevated privileges (e.g., sudo).
		
        ◦ Task:
            ▪ name: Copy index.html to /opt/finance: The name of the task.
            ▪ copy: The Ansible module used to copy files.
            ▪ src: Source file path on the jump host.
            ▪ dest: Destination path on the remote application servers.
            ▪ owner: The owner of the copied file on the destination.
            ▪ group: The group owner of the copied file.
            ▪ mode: The file permission mode set on the copied file.
			
			
Step 3: Execute the Playbook
Run the playbook using the command:


		 #ansible-playbook -i /home/thor/ansible/inventory /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
		 
		 
Explanation:
    • ansible-playbook: The command to run an Ansible playbook.
    • -i /home/thor/ansible/inventory: Specifies the inventory file to be used.
    • /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml: Specifies the playbook to be executed.

Expected Output
After running the playbook, the output should indicate that the file was successfully copied to all application servers.
Example output:


PLAY [Copy index.html to application servers] *********************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ********************************************************
ok: [app01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com]
ok: [app02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com]
ok: [app03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com]

TASK [Copy index.html to /opt/finance] ****************************************
changed: [app01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com]
changed: [app02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com]
changed: [app03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com]

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
app01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com : ok=2  changed=1  unreachable=0  failed=0
app02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com : ok=2  changed=1  unreachable=0  failed=0
app03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com : ok=2  changed=1  unreachable=0  failed=0

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Explanation:
    • ok=2: Two tasks were executed successfully on each server.
    • changed=1: One task resulted in changes (copying the file).
    • unreachable=0, failed=0: No servers were unreachable, and no tasks failed.
