QUESTION:1.An Ansible playbook needs completion on the jump host, where a team member left off. Below are the details:

a.The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory requires adjustments. The playbook must run on App Server 3 in Stratos DC. Update the inventory accordingly.
b.Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml. Include a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 3.

Note: Validation will run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.

ANSWER:

1. Update the Inventory File

The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory needs to be updated to include App Server 3 in Stratos DC.
Assume that App Server 3 has the hostname stapp03 (this is common in such exercises, but you should verify the exact hostname if known). You can update the inventory file like this:
ini

		 #vi /home/thor/ansible/inventory

Inv

	[all]
	stapp03 ansible_host=<ip_of_stapp03> ansible_user=<username>
	
	[app]
	stapp03 ansible_host=<ip_of_stapp03> ansible_user=<username>

e.g.,

	stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_password=BigGr33n ............{ add this line in inventory file}

    • Replace <ip_of_stapp03> with the actual IP address of App Server 3.
    • Replace <username> with the appropriate SSH username for connecting to the server.
	
	
2. Create the Playbook
Next, you need to create the playbook at /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml. This playbook should include a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 3.
Here's how your playbook should look:

		 #vi /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
   
yaml
		
		---
		- hosts: stapp03
		  become: yes
		  tasks:
		    - name: Create an empty file at /tmp/file.txt
		      file:
		        path: /tmp/file.txt
		        state: touch
		
Explanation:
    1. hosts: stapp03: This indicates that the playbook will run on stapp03, which corresponds to App Server 3 as defined in your inventory file.
    2. become: yes: This line allows the playbook to escalate privileges, using sudo if necessary. This is important when working with file paths like /tmp that might require elevated permissions.
    3. tasks: This section contains the list of tasks to perform. In this case, there is only one task.
    4. name: A descriptive name for the task, making it easier to understand when reviewing logs.
    5. file module: The file module is used to manage files and directories in Ansible.
        ◦ path: Specifies the path to the file to be managed (/tmp/file.txt in this case).
        ◦ state: touch: Ensures that the file exists. If the file does not exist, it will be created as an empty file. If it does exist, its modification time will be updated.
		
3. Validation
Once you have updated the inventory and created the playbook, you can validate the setup by running the command:


		 #ansible-playbook -i /home/thor/ansible/inventory /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
		 
This command will execute the playbook using the specified inventory file. It should connect to stapp03, and the task will create an empty file at /tmp/file.txt.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Expected Output :
When you run the playbook, you should see output similar to the following:


PLAY [stapp03] ******************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] **********************************************************
ok: [stapp03]

TASK [Create an empty file at /tmp/file.txt] ************************************
changed: [stapp03]

PLAY RECAP **********************************************************************
stapp03                    : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0  

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 
    • ok=2: Indicates that two tasks were executed successfully (Gathering Facts and the file creation).
    • changed=1: Indicates that one task resulted in a change on the server (i.e., the file was created or its timestamp was updated).
    • unreachable=0, failed=0: No errors occurred during the playbook execution.
	
This confirms that the playbook has run successfully and performed the expected task.
