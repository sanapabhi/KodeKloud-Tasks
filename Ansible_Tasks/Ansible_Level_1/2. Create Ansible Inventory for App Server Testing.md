QUESTION:2.The Nautilus DevOps team is testing Ansible playbooks on various servers within their stack. 
They've placed some playbooks under /home/thor/playbook/ directory on the jump host and now intend to test them on app server 1 in Stratos DC. 
However, an inventory file needs creation for Ansible to connect to the respective app. Here are the requirements:

a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host.
b. Include App Server 1 in this inventory along with necessary variables for proper functionality.
c. Ensure the inventory hostname corresponds to the server name as per the wiki, for example stapp01 for app server 1 in Stratos DC.

Note: Validation will execute the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Ensure the playbook functions properly without any extra arguments

ANSWER:
To meet the requirements for the Nautilus DevOps team's Ansible playbook test, you'll need to create an inventory file in the ini format, which Ansible can use to connect to the specific app server. Below is the step-by-step solution with an explanation and output.
Step 1: Create the Ansible Inventory File
    1. Navigate to the playbook directory: First, you need to navigate to the directory where the playbook is located.
              
		 #cd /home/thor/playbook/
		 
    2. Create the inventory file: Use a text editor like vi, vim, or nano to create the inventory file. Here, we'll use vi as an example.
             
		 #vi inventory
		 
    3. Add the App Server 1 information: Inside the inventory file, add the following lines:
       ini
       
       [app_servers]
       stapp01 ansible_host=<App_Server_1_IP> ansible_user=your_user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/private/key

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````   
	E.g., stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_password=Ir0nM@n
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` 
 Replace <App_Server_1_IP> with the actual IP address of App Server 1, and update your_user with the correct username that has SSH access to the server. Also, specify the correct path to the private key file used for SSH authentication.

Explanation:
    • [app_servers]: This is a group name. You can have multiple hosts under this group.
    • stapp01: This is the hostname you will use in your playbooks to refer to App Server 1.
    • ansible_host: The actual IP address of App Server 1.
    • ansible_user: The username Ansible will use to SSH into the server.
    • ansible_ssh_private_key_file: The path to the private key file used to authenticate the SSH connection.
	

Step 2:To verify if the inventory is correct, let's run a simple ping test. It should return the "ping:pong" response.

		 #ansible -m ping -i inventory all
	Expected Output:
	
		stapp01 | SUCCESS => {
			"ansible_facts": {
				"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
			}, 
			"changed": false, 
			"ping": "pong"
		}
		
Step 3: Verify the Playbook Execution
Once the inventory file is created, you can test your playbook by running the following command:

		 #ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
		 
This command tells Ansible to use the inventory file you just created and run the playbook specified in playbook.yml.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Output Example:
If everything is set up correctly, you should see an output similar to the following:
plaintext

PLAY [Playbook Name] *****************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ******************************************************************
ok: [stapp01]

TASK [Example Task] ******************************************************************
changed: [stapp01]

...

PLAY RECAP **************************************************************************
stapp01                   : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

    • ok=2: Number of tasks successfully executed.
    • changed=1: Number of tasks that made changes to the remote host.
    • unreachable=0: The target host is reachable.
    • failed=0: No tasks failed.
	
Step 4: Troubleshooting
If the playbook fails, ensure:
    • The IP address, username, and private key path are correct.
    • The SSH connection is working properly.
    • The ansible_host in the inventory file matches the IP of App Server 1.
This setup should allow the DevOps team to test their Ansible playbook on App Server 1 successfully.
