Question:3.The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:

a. Install tomcat server on App Server 3.
b. Configure it to run on port 3002.
c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.

Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp03:3002


Answer: 

Step-by-Step Solution

1. SSH into App Server 3

● Use SSH to log in to App Server 3 as the banner user from the Jump host.

		thor@jumphost ~$ ssh banner@stapp03

		banner@stapp03's password: BigGr33n

● After logging in, switch to the root user using sudo:

		[banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su -
		
		[sudo] password for banner:BigGr33n

Explanation:

● ssh banner@stapp03: Connect to App Server 3 via SSH.

● sudo su -: Switch to the root user for administrative tasks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Install Tomcat Server

Install the Tomcat server on App Server 3 using the package manager.

		[root@stapp03 ~]# yum install tomcat -y

Explanation:

● yum install tomcat -y: Installs the Tomcat server and automatically confirms the installation (-y flag).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● (Before Changes)To identify the ports your Tomcat server is listening on and configured for—whether it’s for HTTP, HTTPS, shutdown, or other protocols like AJP.

		[root@stapp03 ~]# cat /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml |grep port
			
			Output:
			
				<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
						 Define a non-SSL/TLS HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080
					<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
							   port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
					<!-- Define an SSL/TLS HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443
					<Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
					<!-- Define an SSL/TLS HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 with HTTP/2
					<Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol"
					<!-- Define an AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->
							   port="8009"
					<!-- You should set jvmRoute to support load-balancing via AJP ie :-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Configure Tomcat to Run on Port 3002
Tomcat's default configuration listens on port 8080. We need to change it to port 3002. The configuration file is located at /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml.

[root@stapp03 ~]# vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml

● Find the following lines in the configuration file:

		<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
				   connectionTimeout="20000"
				   redirectPort="8443" 
				   maxParameterCount="1000"
				   />

● Change the port value from 8080 to 3002:


		<Connector port="3002" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
				   connectionTimeout="20000"
				   redirectPort="8443" 
				   maxParameterCount="1000"
				   />
Save and exit the file.

Explanation:

● We modified the default port from 8080 to 3002 to meet the requirements.

● vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml: Open the Tomcat configuration file in vi editor for editing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● (After Changes) To identify the ports your Tomcat server is listening on and configured for—whether it’s for HTTP, HTTPS, shutdown, or other protocols like AJP.

		[root@stapp03 ~]# cat /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml |grep port

			Output:
			
			<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
					 Define a non-SSL/TLS HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080
				<Connector port="3002" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
						   port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
				<!-- Define an SSL/TLS HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443
				<Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
				<!-- Define an SSL/TLS HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 with HTTP/2
				<Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol"
				<!-- Define an AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->
						   port="8009"
				<!-- You should set jvmRoute to support load-balancing via AJP ie :"-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Copy and Deploy the WAR File

Switch back to the Jump host to copy the ROOT.war file to App Server 3, then deploy it on Tomcat.

● On the Jump host, execute:

		thor@jumphost ~$ scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@stapp03:/tmp
		
		banner@stapp03's password:BigGr33n
			Output:
				ROOT.war                                               100% 4529     4.0MB/s   00:00    
				
● Next, on App Server 3, move the ROOT.war file to Tomcat’s webapps directory:

		[root@stapp03 ~]# cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
		
		
● Verify the file has been copied:

		[root@stapp03 ~]# ls -l /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
			Output:
			
			total 8
			-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4529 Oct 16 15:18 ROOT.war
Explanation:

● scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@stapp03:/tmp: Securely copy the WAR file from the Jump host to App Server 3.

● cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/: Move the WAR file to Tomcat's webapps directory. Tomcat automatically deploys any WAR file placed in this directory.

● ls -l /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/: List the contents of the webapps directory to verify the WAR file was copied.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Restart the Tomcat Service
After copying the WAR file, restart the Tomcat service to apply the changes and deploy the application.

		[root@stapp03 ~]# systemctl restart tomcat

		[root@stapp03 ~]# systemctl status tomcat

Expected Output:

			● tomcat.service - Apache Tomcat Web Application Container
				 Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/tomcat.service; disabled; preset: disabled)
				 Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-10-16 15:19:18 UTC; 14s ago
			   Main PID: 3697 (java)	
				  Tasks: 37 (limit: 1340692)
				 Memory: 123.6M
Explanation:

● systemctl restart tomcat: Restart the Tomcat service to apply the new configuration and deploy the application.

● systemctl status tomcat: Check the status of the Tomcat service to ensure it is running.

6. Verify the Deployment

● Now that the application has been deployed, verify that the webpage is accessible on port 3002 by using curl.

		[root@stapp03 ~]# curl http://stapp03:3002

Expected Output:

Explanation:

● curl http://stapp03:3002: Sends a request to the server to check if the application is successfully deployed and running on port 3002. The expected result is an HTML page with a welcome message.






To solve this task of setting up a Tomcat server on App Server 3 and deploying a Java application (WAR file), follow these steps in detail. I will provide an explanation of each step, including the commands used and their respective outputs.

Step-by-Step Solution
1. SSH into App Server 3
Use SSH to log in to App Server 3 as the banner user from the Jump host.



thor@jumphost ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
The authenticity of host 'stapp03 (172.16.238.12)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:Tw56jF9zYAziNaMu8BueAIEkg5jtHF49eBqUei1qIQU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'stapp03' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
banner@stapp03's password: 
[banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for banner:
Explanation:

ssh banner@stapp03: Connect to App Server 3 via SSH.
sudo su -: Switch to the root user for administrative tasks.
2. Install Tomcat Server
Install the Tomcat server on App Server 3 using the package manager.



[root@stapp03 ~]# yum install tomcat -y
Explanation:

yum install tomcat -y: Installs the Tomcat server and automatically confirms the installation (-y flag).
3. Configure Tomcat to Run on Port 3002
Tomcat's default configuration listens on port 8080. We need to change it to port 3002. The configuration file is located at /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml.



[root@stapp03 ~]# vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml
Find the following lines in the configuration file:

xml

<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443" />
Change the port from 8080 to 3002:

xml

<Connector port="3002" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443" />
Save and exit the file.

Explanation:

We modified the default port from 8080 to 3002 to meet the requirements.
vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml: Open the Tomcat configuration file in vi editor for editing.
4. Copy and Deploy the WAR File
Switch back to the Jump host to copy the ROOT.war file to App Server 3, then deploy it on Tomcat.

On the Jump host, execute:



thor@jumphost ~$ scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@stapp03:/tmp
banner@stapp03's password:

Next, on App Server 3, move the ROOT.war file to Tomcat’s webapps directory:



[root@stapp03 ~]# cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
Verify the file has been copied:



[root@stapp03 ~]# ls -l /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4529 Oct 16 15:18 ROOT.war
Explanation:

scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@stapp03:/tmp: Securely copy the WAR file from the Jump host to App Server 3.
cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/: Move the WAR file to Tomcat's webapps directory. Tomcat automatically deploys any WAR file placed in this directory.
ls -l /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/: List the contents of the webapps directory to verify the WAR file was copied.
5. Restart the Tomcat Service
After copying the WAR file, restart the Tomcat service to apply the changes and deploy the application.



[root@stapp03 ~]# systemctl restart tomcat
[root@stapp03 ~]# systemctl status tomcat
