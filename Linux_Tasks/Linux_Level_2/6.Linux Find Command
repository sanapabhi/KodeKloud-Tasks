QUESTION:6.During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. Some malicious content was identified within the website code. 
After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. 
Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:

a. On App Server 1 at location /var/www/html/news find out all files (not directories) having .js extension.
b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /news on same server.
c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/news directory content.

ANSWER:

Here are the detailed steps and commands to accomplish the task:
Step-by-Step Instructions
    1. Find all .js files in /var/www/html/news:
        ◦ Use the find command to locate all files with the .js extension in the specified directory.
        ◦ Ensure that only files (not directories) are included in the search results.
    2. Copy the found files along with their parent directory structure:
        ◦ Use the cp command with the --parents option to preserve the directory structure while copying the files.
        ◦ Copy the files to the /news directory on the same server.
Commands
    1. Find all .js files:
		 #find /var/www/html/news -type f -name "*.js"
		 
    2. Copy the found files to /news while preserving the directory structure:
		 #find /var/www/html/news -type f -name "*.js" -exec cp --parents {} /news \;
		 
Explanation
    • find /var/www/html/news -type f -name "*.js":
        ◦ find: Command to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
        ◦ /var/www/html/news: The directory to start the search.
        ◦ -type f: Restricts the search to files only.
        ◦ -name "*.js": Looks for files with the .js extension.
    • -exec cp --parents {} /news \;:
        ◦ -exec: Executes the specified command on each found file.
        ◦ cp --parents {}: Copies the file while preserving its parent directory structure.
        ◦ /news: The destination directory.
        ◦ \;: Indicates the end of the -exec command.
		
Example

Let’s say you have the following directory structure:
/var/www/html/news/
├── dir1
│   └── script1.js
├── dir2
│   └── script2.js
└── dir3
    └── script3.js
After running the commands, the /news directory will have the following structure:
/news/
├── var
│   └── www
│       └── html
│           └── news
│               ├── dir1
│               │   └── script1.js
│               ├── dir2
│               │   └── script2.js
│               └── dir3
│                   └── script3.js
This way, you ensure that only the .js files and their parent directories are copied, without copying the entire /var/www/html/news directory content.
