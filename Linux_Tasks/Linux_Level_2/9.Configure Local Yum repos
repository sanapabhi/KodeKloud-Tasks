ANSWER:
 	Here are the detailed steps and commands to achieve this:
	Step-by-Step Instructions
	1. Connect to the Nautilus Backup Server
	First, you need to connect to the Nautilus Backup Server via SSH.
	 #ssh your_username@nautilus_backup_server
	 
	2. Switch to the Root User
	Once connected, switch to the root user to have the necessary permissions.
	 #sudo su -
	 
	3. Create the Yum Repository Configuration File
	Navigate to the yum repository configuration directory and create a new repository file.
	 #cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
	 #vi yum_local.repo
	 
	4. Add Repository Configuration
	Edit the yum_local.repo file to include the following configuration:
	[yum_local]
	name=yum_local
	baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
	enabled=1
	gpgcheck=0
	Save and exit the editor.

	Expanation Configuration file:
    • Repository ID: yum_local
    • Name: yum_local
    • Base URL: file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
    • Enabled: 1 (to enable the repository)
    • GPG Check: 0 (to disable GPG check)

	5. Clean Yum Cache and Verify Repository
	Clean the yum cache to ensure the new repository is recognized and then verify the repository.
	 #yum clean all
	 #yum repolist
	 
	6. Install the wget Package
