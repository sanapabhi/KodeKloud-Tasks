QUESTION:7.As per new application requirements shared by the Nautilus project development team, serveral new packages need to be installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
Most of them are completed except for telnet.

Therefore, install the telnet package on all app-servers.

ANSWER:

 Here are the detailed steps and commands to install the telnet package on all app servers in the Stratos Datacenter.
Steps to Install Telnet
    1. SSH into each app server:
        ◦ You need to SSH into each app server using the appropriate credentials. For example, if you have three app servers with IP addresses 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11, and 192.168.1.12, you would SSH into each one.
    2. Install the Telnet package:
        ◦ Once you are logged into each server, you can install the telnet package using the package manager.
Commands

Example for CentOS/RHEL-based systems:

    1. SSH into the server:
       ssh user@192.168.1.10
	   
    2. Switch to the root user (if necessary):
       sudo su -
	   
    3. Install the Telnet package:
       yum install -y telnet
	   
    4. Verify the installation:
       telnet -version
	   
Example for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
    1. SSH into the server:
       ssh user@192.168.1.10
	   
    2. Switch to the root user (if necessary):
       sudo su -
	   
    3. Update the package list:
       apt update
	   
    4. Install the Telnet package:
       apt install -y telnet
	   
    5. Verify the installation:
       telnet -version

Automating the Process
If you have multiple servers, you might want to automate this process using a script or a configuration management tool like Ansible.
Example Bash Script:
#!/bin/bash

# List of app servers
servers=("192.168.1.10" "192.168.1.11" "192.168.1.12")

# Loop through each server and install telnet
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
  #ssh user@$server << EOF
  #sudo su -
  #yum install -y telnet || apt install -y telnet
  #telnet -version
EOF
done

Example Ansible Playbook:
---
- name: Install Telnet on all app servers
  hosts: app_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Telnet
      package:
        name: telnet
        state: present
Running the Ansible Playbook
    1. Create an inventory file (hosts):
       [app_servers]
       192.168.1.10
       192.168.1.11
       192.168.1.12
    2. Run the playbook:
       ansible-playbook -i hosts install_telnet.yml
This should help you install the telnet package on all app servers in the Stratos Datacenter.
