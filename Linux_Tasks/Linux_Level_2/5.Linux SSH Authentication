QUESTION:5.The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). Based on the requirements, perform the following:

1.Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

ANSWER:

 @1st check your login as thor user  on the server
		#whoami
		Output:
			thor
		 
set up password-less SSH authentication from the thor user on the jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users. Here are the detailed steps and commands:
Steps to Set Up Password-less SSH Authentication
    1. Log in to the Jump Host as the thor User:
       #ssh thor@jump_host
	   
    2. Generate an SSH Key Pair for the thor User: If you haven’t already generated an SSH key pair, you can do so using the following command:
       #ssh-keygen -t rsa
	   
       Follow the prompts to save the key pair in the default location (/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa) and optionally set a passphrase.
	   
	   > Find the public key:

	   #cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	   
    3. Copy the Public Key to Each App Server: Use the ssh-copy-id command to copy the public key to each app server. Replace app_server_user with the respective sudo user for each app server (e.g., tony for app server 1).
        
       For App Server 1:
       #ssh-copy-id tony@app_server_1
		
       For App Server 2:
       #ssh-copy-id steve@app_server_2
	   
       #For App Server 3:
       ssh-copy-id banner@app_server_3
	   
    4. Verify Password-less SSH Access: After copying the public key, verify that you can SSH into each app server without being prompted for a password.
        
       For App Server 1:
       #ssh tony@app_server_1
	   
       For App Server 2:
       #ssh steve@app_server_2
	   
       For App Server 3:
       #ssh banner@app_server_3

Example Commands:

    1. Generate SSH Key Pair:
       thor@jump_host:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
		 > Generating public/private rsa key pair.
		 > Enter file in which to save the key (/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press Enter]
		 > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press Enter]
		 > Enter same passphrase again: [Press Enter]
		 > Your identification has been saved in /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.
		 > Your public key has been saved in /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	   
    2. Copy Public Key to App Server 1:
       thor@jump_host:~$ ssh-copy-id tony@app_server_1
	   
    3. Verify SSH Access to App Server 1:
       thor@jump_host:~$ ssh tony@app_server_1
	   
       [tony@app_server_1 ~]$

By following these steps, you should be able to set up password-less SSH access from the thor user on the jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users
