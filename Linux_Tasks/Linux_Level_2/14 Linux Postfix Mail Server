QUESTION:
xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:

1. Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.
2. Create an email account ravi@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by 8FmzjvFU6S.
3. Set its mail directory to /home/ravi/Maildir.
4. Install and configure dovecot on the same server.

ANSWER:

Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to set up a mail server using Postfix as the MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) and Dovecot as the IMAP/POP3 server on a CentOS system.
1. Install and Configure Postfix
Step 1: Install Postfix
First, install Postfix using the package manager.


sudo yum install postfix -y
Explanation:
    • yum install postfix -y: Installs the Postfix package along with any dependencies automatically with a -y option, confirming all prompts.
Step 2: Configure Postfix
Edit the Postfix configuration file (/etc/postfix/main.cf) to set up basic parameters.


sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
Find and modify the following parameters:
    • Set the hostname:
      
      
      myhostname = mail.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
    • Set the domain name:
      
      
      mydomain = stratos.xfusioncorp.com
    • Set the origin:
      
      
      myorigin = $mydomain
    • Set the destination:
      
      
      mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
    • Set the mail directory:
      
      
      home_mailbox = Maildir/
    • Disable relay (for security):
      
      
      relayhost =
Save the file and exit.
Explanation:
    • myhostname: Defines the hostname of the mail server.
    • mydomain: Defines the domain name.
    • myorigin: Sets the domain name for outbound emails.
    • mydestination: Specifies domains that this server will deliver to locally.
    • home_mailbox: Specifies that the mail will be delivered to the Maildir format in the user's home directory.
Step 3: Start and Enable Postfix Service


sudo systemctl start postfix
sudo systemctl enable postfix
Explanation:
    • systemctl start postfix: Starts the Postfix service.
    • systemctl enable postfix: Ensures the Postfix service starts automatically on boot.
2. Create Email Account ravi@stratos.xfusioncorp.com
Step 1: Add the User ravi
Create the user ravi with the specified password.


sudo useradd ravi
echo '8FmzjvFU6S' | sudo passwd --stdin ravi
Explanation:
    • useradd ravi: Creates a new user named ravi.
    • passwd --stdin ravi: Sets the password for the user ravi to 8FmzjvFU6S.
Step 2: Set Mail Directory
Ensure that the Maildir is the default mail storage format for the user.


sudo mkdir /home/ravi/Maildir
sudo chown -R ravi:ravi /home/ravi/Maildir
Explanation:
    • mkdir /home/ravi/Maildir: Creates the Maildir directory.
    • chown -R ravi:ravi: Ensures that ravi owns the Maildir directory.
3. Install and Configure Dovecot
Step 1: Install Dovecot
Install Dovecot using the package manager.


sudo yum install dovecot -y
Explanation:
    • yum install dovecot -y: Installs the Dovecot package along with its dependencies.
Step 2: Configure Dovecot
Edit the Dovecot configuration files:
    • Edit /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf:
      
      
      sudo nano /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
      Uncomment the following line:
      
      
      protocols = imap pop3 lmtp
    • Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf:
      
      
      sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
      Find and modify:
      
      
      mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
    • Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf:
      
      
      sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
      Ensure the following lines are uncommented:
      
      
      disable_plaintext_auth = no
      auth_mechanisms = plain login
    • Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf:
      
      
      sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf
      Uncomment the following block to allow Dovecot to work with Postfix:
      
      
      service imap-login {
        inet_listener imap {
          port = 143
        }
      }
      
      service pop3-login {
        inet_listener pop3 {
          port = 110
        }
      }
Step 3: Start and Enable Dovecot Service


sudo systemctl start dovecot
sudo systemctl enable dovecot
Explanation:
    • systemctl start dovecot: Starts the Dovecot service.
    • systemctl enable dovecot: Ensures the Dovecot service starts automatically on boot.
4. Verify the Setup
Step 1: Check the Postfix Service
To check if Postfix is running correctly:


sudo systemctl status postfix
Output: You should see a status indicating that Postfix is active and running.
Step 2: Check the Dovecot Service
To check if Dovecot is running correctly:


sudo systemctl status dovecot
Output: You should see a status indicating that Dovecot is active and running.
Conclusion
You have successfully installed and configured Postfix as the mail transfer agent and Dovecot as the IMAP/POP3 server. You also created an email account ravi@stratos.xfusioncorp.com with the specified mail directory /home/ravi/Maildir.
